Registering your package allows others to install it with a short name, like bower install <my-package-name>.

To register a new package:

-The package name must adhere to the bower.json spec.
-There must be a valid bower.json in the project’s root directory.
-Your package should use semver Git tags. The v prefix is allowed.
-Your package must be publically available at a Git endpoint (e.g., GitHub). Remember to push your Git tags!
-For private packages (e.g. GitHub Enterprise), please consider running a private Bower registry.

Then use bower register:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
|    $ bower register <my-package-name> <git-endpoint>		|
|    # for example						|
|    $ bower register example git://github.com/user/example.git	|
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Now anyone can run bower install <my-package-name>, and get your library installed. The Bower registry does not have authentication or user management at this point in time. It’s on a first come, first served basis.
